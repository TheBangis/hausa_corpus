# A Dataset For Text Classification in Hausa

# Project Description 

### This project focuses on classifying Hausa text as either machine-generated or human-generated. We fine-tuned four pre-trained Afri-centric models (AfriTeVa, AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, and AfroXLMR-76L) on the resulting dataset and assessed their performance using accuracy and F1-score metrics.
